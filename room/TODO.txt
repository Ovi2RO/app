- HTML needs to have a button to create a chat
- HTML new to show all rooms associated with the user
- create users and posts to try this on
- Chat should display the post from which it was started
- Each app must be able to start a chat(
    - Marketplace
    - Laika
    - Tennis
    - Parenting
)
- Room shouldn't delete, the only thing that should be carried over is the post banner
x List view to list all the chats associated to the user
x Permissions so that only the 2 users have access to the chat (mixin)(test
if the creation and access to the chat works before)
x Another room should not be created if the user is already talking
  to the person about that post (same 2 users, same post = no new room, redirect instead)
x Models made adequate(
    x they need to be able to reference any post from any app
)
